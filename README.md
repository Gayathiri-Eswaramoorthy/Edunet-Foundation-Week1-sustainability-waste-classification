#  Edunet Foundation – Week 1: Sustainability Project  
## Waste Classification using CNN

This project is part of the **Edunet Foundation Internship on Sustainability**.  
It focuses on developing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for automatic waste classification to support **sustainable waste management** and recycling initiatives.

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** [Garbage Dataset by Suman Kunwar – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification)
- **Classes:** Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Trash
- **Preparation:**
  - Removed duplicate and unreadable images
  - Organized into labeled `train/` and `test/` folders
  - Ensured balanced class distribution

---

## Objective
To build an image classification model that can automatically identify waste categories, promoting **efficient recycling** and **smart waste management** as part of sustainable practices.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn, OpenCV
